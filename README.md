# Description

Overview
Automated report generation is a fundamental component of data-driven environments, allowing for quick insights, efficient communication, and a reduction in manual labor. As part of CodTech Internship Task 2, this project focuses on creating a script that reads structured data from a file, analyzes it, and automatically generates a well-formatted report in PDF format.
The deliverable includes:

A Python script that reads, analyzes, and formats the data
A visually structured PDF report containing all relevant data insights
Optional: Charts and visualizations embedded within the report

Objectives
Automate the process of generating reports from data
Use data analysis libraries like pandas to extract insights
Use PDF libraries such as FPDF or ReportLab to generate reports
Include both textual summaries and visualizations
Improve data-to-decision turnaround time


Tools & Technologies Used
Library     Purpose
pandas      Data reading, cleaning, analysis
numpy       Numerical calculations
matplotlib  Charts and visualizations
seaborn     Advanced visualizations
fpdf        PDF report generation
tabulate    Tabular formatting for display

Sample Workflow

Load the CSV file using pandas
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Generate summary statistics (mean, median, std. deviation)
Visualize important trends using charts
Format results and embed them into a styled PDF


Setup Instructions
Clone the repository or download the code.
Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn fpdf reportlab tabulate


Add your data file (.csv) to the root directory.
Run the script:

python generate_report.py


Functional Highlights
Data Analysis Includes:

Column-wise summary statistics
Count of missing values
Data type categorization
Correlation matrix
Grouped aggregations

Output Includes:

Header with project title and author
Summary tables (tabulated)
Graphs embedded into the PDF
Custom footers with timestamp and report note


How the Script Works
Step 1: Read the Dataset
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('sample_data.csv')

Step 2: Summary Statistics
summary = df.describe()
missing = df.isnull().sum()

Step 3: Create Visualizations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df['column_name'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.savefig('bar_chart.png')

Step 4: Generate PDF with FPDF
from fpdf import FPDF
pdf = FPDF()
pdf.add_page()
pdf.set_font("Arial", size=12)
pdf.cell(200, 10, txt="Automated Report", ln=1, align='C')
pdf.output("report.pdf")


Advanced Features to Consider

Embedding charts dynamically
Grouped statistics (e.g., mean by category)
Conditional formatting (e.g., highlight high values)
Support for multiple file types (Excel, JSON)
Style template integration using ReportLab canvas
